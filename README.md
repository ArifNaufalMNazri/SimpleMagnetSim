# SimpleMagnetSim
This is a magnet simulator that I made for a physics presentation in school. I learned how to use OpenGL, vectors, and how to apply the mathematics I learned in school to create this project. I'm really proud with how it turned out.

## Learning OpenGL 
<p>I needed to learn OpenGL to make the simulator. To do this, I used youtube videos and made my own projects to practice before moving on with this project.</p>
