# SimpleMagnetSim
This is a magnet simulator that I made for a physics presentation in school. I learned how to use OpenGL, vectors, and how to apply the mathematics I learned in school to create this project. I'm really proud with how it turned out.

## Learning OpenGL 
<p>I needed to learn OpenGL to make the simulator. To do this, I used youtube videos and made my own projects to practice before moving on with this project.</p>

## Learning the maths
I tried learning the mathematics behind drawing a magnetic field and implementing them into the draw loop, but it proved to be very complicated and complex. I learned a lot about vectors, but in the end trying to draw the exact magnetic field was too difficult of an endeavor. So, I decided to replace it with circles that act as the amagnetic field.
